# Finite-Interval-Parameter-and-State-Estimation-in-LTI-Systems-Using-Kernel-Based-Multiple-Regression:

A recursive version of a generalized least squares for parameter estimation in Reproducing
Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) is presented in the master's thesis. It begins with the understanding
and derivation of a special construction of a forward-backward kernel representation of
linear differential invariants for a third-order linear system. Methods for parameter and
state estimation from single noisy realizations of the system output on a time interval
[a, b] is discussed. Parameter estimation is solved by the way of stochastic regression.
Generalized Least squares with covariance weighting is employed to deal with high noise.
Once the recursive approach estimates the parameters, the output and time derivatives are
reconstructed by projection onto the span of fundamental solutions.
